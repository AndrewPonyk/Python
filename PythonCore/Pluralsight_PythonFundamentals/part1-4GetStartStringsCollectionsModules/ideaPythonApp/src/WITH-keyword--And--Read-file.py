#In Python, the with statement is used to define a block of code that should be executed in the context
# of a certain resource, such as a file, database connection, or network socket.

#The with statement creates a context in which the resource is available, and takes care of closing the
# resource when the block of code exits. This makes the code more concise and reduces
# the risk of resource leaks, because it ensures that the resource is properly released even if an exception is raised within the block.
